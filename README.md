📊 Revenue Performance Analysis | Excel Dashboard + SQL
🚀 Project Summary

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow using Microsoft Excel and SQL to evaluate revenue, profitability, product performance, and store-level trends from 2011–2014.

The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights through structured data cleaning, pivot analysis, dashboard visualization, and strategic recommendations.

🎯 Business Objective

To identify:

Top-performing product groups

Best-selling outlets

Highest revenue-generating producers

Profitability trends over time

All reporting and visualization were built using a Microsoft Excel Dashboard.

🧹 Data Preparation & Cleaning

Identified and handled missing data (Volume & Revenue alignment).

Recalculated Revenue using:
Revenue = Price per Unit × Volume

Removed non-analytical code/ID columns.

Validated consistency across Revenue, Profit, and Margin fields.

✔ Demonstrates statistical reasoning and data validation practices.

🛢 SQL Integration

A simple relational database structure was designed to:

Aggregate revenue by product and year

Rank top producers

Calculate profit margins

Group performance by store type

✔ Demonstrates ability to structure analytical datasets for database environments.
